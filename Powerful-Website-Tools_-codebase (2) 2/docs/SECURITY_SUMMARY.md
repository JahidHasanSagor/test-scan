## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Rate Limiting Protection**
Prevents brute force attacks on authentication endpoints:
- **Login:** Max 5 attempts per 15 minutes → 30-minute lockout
- **Signup:** Max 3 attempts per hour → 1-hour lockout
- **API:** Max 100 requests per 15 minutes

**Files:**
- `src/lib/security/rate-limiter.ts` - Rate limiting engine
- `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` - Applied to auth endpoints

### 2. **Password Strength Validation**
Enforces strong passwords with real-time feedback:
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- ✅ Uppercase & lowercase letters
- ✅ Numbers & special characters
- ✅ Blocks common passwords ("password123", "admin", etc.)
- ✅ Detects sequential patterns ("abc", "123")
- ✅ Visual strength indicator (Weak → Very Strong)

**Files:**
- `src/lib/security/password-validator.ts` - Validation logic
- `src/components/auth/auth-tabs.tsx` - Real-time UI feedback
- `src/app/register/register-form.tsx` - Registration with validation

### 3. **Input Sanitization**
Protects against XSS and injection attacks:
- ✅ HTML entity escaping
- ✅ Email validation & normalization
- ✅ SQL injection pattern detection
- ✅ Name/text sanitization
- ✅ URL validation (http/https only)
- ✅ Maximum length enforcement

**Files:**
- `src/lib/security/input-sanitizer.ts` - Sanitization utilities
- Applied in all authentication forms

### 4. **Security Headers**
HTTP security headers configured in middleware:
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: enabled
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- ✅ Permissions-Policy (restricts camera, mic, location)

**File:** `middleware.ts`

### 5. **Enhanced Authentication UI**
User-friendly security features:
- ✅ Real-time password strength meter
- ✅ Visual requirement checklist
- ✅ Password confirmation validation
- ✅ Disabled submit until requirements met
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Social authentication (Google, GitHub)

**Files:**
- `src/components/auth/auth-tabs.tsx`
- `src/app/login/login-form.tsx`
- `src/app/register/register-form.tsx`

### 6. **Security Vulnerability Scanner**
Automated security assessment tool:
- ✅ Scans 12 security categories
- ✅ Provides detailed recommendations
- ✅ Calculates security score & grade
- ✅ Tracks critical/high/medium/low issues
- ✅ Shows pass/fail status for each check

**Files:**
- `src/lib/security/scanner.ts` - Scanner engine
- `src/app/api/security/scan/route.ts` - Scan API endpoint
- `src/app/admin/security/page.tsx` - Security dashboard

## 🎯 How to Access Security Dashboard

1. Navigate to: **`/admin/security`**
2. Dashboard automatically runs security scan
3. View your security score, grade, and detailed report
4. Click "Rescan" to re-run checks after improvements

## ⚠️ Current Warnings (Non-Critical)

### 1. Security Headers (Medium)
- **Status:** Warning
- **Issue:** Security headers may not be fully configured
- **Action:** Headers are set in middleware; verify in production deployment
- **Impact:** Low (already configured, needs production verification)

### 2. HTTPS Enforcement (Medium)
- **Status:** Warning
- **Issue:** Running on http:// in development
- **Action:** Deploy with HTTPS in production (automatically handled by most hosting)
- **Impact:** None in development; critical for production

### 3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium)
- **Status:** Warning
- **Issue:** Dependencies should be regularly updated
- **Action:** Run `npm audit` and keep packages updated
- **Impact:** Low (requires periodic maintenance)

## 🚀 Next Steps for Security Improvements

### Immediate (Optional)
1. ✅ **All critical security implemented** - You're good to go!

### Future Enhancements
1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** - Add authenticator app support
2. **Email Verification** - Verify email addresses for new accounts
3. **Password Reset** - Implement forgot password functionality
4. **Login History** - Track and display login attempts
5. **Suspicious Activity Detection** - Alert on unusual login patterns
6. **Security Audit Logging** - Log all security events
7. **Regular Dependency Updates** - Schedule weekly `npm audit` runs

## 🧪 Testing Your Security Features

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Try multiple failed login attempts
# After 5 attempts in 15 minutes → account locked for 30 minutes
```

### Test Password Validation
Try registering with these passwords:
- ❌ `"weak"` - Too short
- ❌ `"Password1"` - Missing special character  
- ❌ `"Pass123!"` - Too short
- ✅ `"Password123!"` - Valid (Medium-Strong)
- ✅ `"MyP@ssw0rd2024!"` - Very Strong

### Test Input Sanitization
The system automatically blocks/sanitizes:
- `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in any field
- SQL injection patterns like `admin' OR '1'='1`
- Invalid email formats
- Names with HTML tags
